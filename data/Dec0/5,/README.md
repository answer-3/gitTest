In a quiet valley of western Honduras lie the ruins of Copán—a city of the ancient Maya civilization. Its sky served as both compass and calendar, guiding celestial events and shaping temples, rituals, and the rhythm of life. Around 426 CE, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', a warrior from the Maya heartland, founded Copán and established its royal dynasty. The city became a center of Maya art, astronomy, and power.
